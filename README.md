# CS50

I am using this repo as a place to store the psets I am working on. Some major differences are that I am writing nearly all of my programs in Go. Assignments for cs50 are done in the cloud9 IDE and the staff has a lot of helper functionality build into this. This was my reasoning for using Go. As it will ease the C parts of the cs50 course, can almost definiltey work out the Python parts, and it should be able to handle anything else the course throws at it.

## Getting Started

Nearly all of the programs are written in Go, with Go installed on your computer you should be able to go into any problem set's directory run 
```
go build
```
(Note: In retrospect I am realizing that unless your gopath is set properly this might not work, and my next task will be to structure this differently)

### Prerequisites

Go. And a C compiler if you are curious about the first problem set.

## Built With
* [cs50](https://cs50.harvard.edu/weeks) - The course work I followed
* [Go](https://golang.org/) - A great general purpose programming language to get work done.
